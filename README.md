## Expectations

-   Github actions should pass for all tests
-   Each function should have a robust set of tests with at least three `expect` statements (excluding the render functions which can simply check `outerHTML`).
-   Each `expect` statement should have a third argument describing the specific thing being tested with this expect statement.
-   use `expect.deepEqual(actual, expected);` on every test

- 1 point per function with 3 expectations each
- 1 free starter point (since there are only 9 functions)
- everything after line 150 is a stretch goal (last 3 functions)
